.SH DESCRIPTION
.Nm
It is a basic command interpreter for the operating system. It allows communication between the Unix distribution and the user.
It has two modes of operation. Interactive and non-interactive.
Look at the examples for more information.
.Nm
.Nm
This version has many features which make it appear similar in some respects to the Bash shell,
but it is not a Bash shell clone (see.Xr sh 1 ) .
.Nm
.SH Overview
The shell is a command that reads lines from either a file or the
terminal, interprets them, and generally executes other commands.
It is the program that is running when a user logs into the system
(although a user can select a different shell with the
.Xr chsh 1
command).
The shell implements a language that has flow control
constructs, a macro facility that provides a variety of features in
addition to data storage, along with built in history and line editing
capabilities.
It incorporates many features to aid interactive use and
has the advantage that the interpretative language is common to both
interactive and non-interactive use (shell scripts).
